Game:
Defender Dodge

Description:
My game is a classic arcade style game where you must maneuver your player in and out of the oncoming defenders by using the left and right arrow keys. The defenders will appear at the top of the page and run towards you trying to tackle you. As you proceed to the next level the defenders will appear quicker and with more of them, it becomes increasingly difficult to avoid their tackles.

Technologies used:
Used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
Used collision detection to check to see if the player hit one of the defenders
Used intervals to loop my functions. Used to to keep looping my function checking for collision constantly, as well as for my levels to continually drop defenders. 


Unsolved Problems:
I was unable to stop the score counter on the side of the game after the game ended. But i was able to stop the score on the game over screen by pushing the player off the screen on losing to stop interference with the score.
