Game:
Defender Dodge

Description:
My game is a classic arcade style game where you must maneuver your player in and out of the oncoming defenders by using the left and right arrow keys. The defenders will appear at the top of the page and run towards you trying to tackle you. As you proceed to the next level the defenders will appear quicker and with more of them, it becomes increasingly difficult to avoid their tackles.
